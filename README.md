# ``fer``: Framework for Experimental Results

## Data structure
We have developed a JSON schema for the ``fer`` data structure that includes the main and auxiliary data structures (such as QuantityValues, Measurement, and Source) and respects the nested relationships between them. It can be found [here]().

### Examples

## Implementations

A Python-based implementation of the fer data structure can be found [here](https://github.com/jongablop/fer-py).
